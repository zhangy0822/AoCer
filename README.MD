# Consensus Knowledge Exploitation for Partial Query Based Image Retrieval

Our source code of AoCer accepted by TCSVT will be released as soon as possible. It is built on top of the [Ask&Confirm](https://github.com/CuthbertCai/Ask-Confirm) in PyTorch. 
## Data
We organize all data used in the experiments in the same manner as [Ask&Confirm](https://github.com/CuthbertCai/Ask-Confirm) in PyTorch.
