# Consensus Knowledge Exploitation for Partial Query Based Image Retrieval (TCSVT 2023)

Our source code is built on top of the [Ask&Confirm](https://github.com/CuthbertCai/Ask-Confirm) in PyTorch.

## Data
We organize all data used in the experiments in the same manner as [Ask&Confirm](https://github.com/CuthbertCai/Ask-Confirm) in PyTorch.
